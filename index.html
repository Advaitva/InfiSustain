				As a fossil fuel burned for heat, coal still supplies about a quarter of the world's energy.
It is the largest anthropogenic source  of carbon dioxide amounting to about 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions. As part of the worldwide energy transition, many countries have stopped using or use less coal

			Fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas supply almost 80% of the world's energy and are the primary human source of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Even pretending for a moment that climate change doesnt matter and completely ignoring greenhouse effect, global temperature effect, ocean acidification and sea-level rise, it becomes clear from a long term point of view that we still need a plan for our energy future. Fossil fuels are fundamentally limited resources and will be gone sooner or later. Renewable sources like wind, solar and hydroelectric power have a different limitation-they are inconsistent. Therefore. the only long term solution comes from sources like nuclear fusion, but till the time technology is not feasable, we need to transition away from conventional sources as soon as possible to minimize the harm done to our planet.
